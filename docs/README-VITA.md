## Known Issues

- Enabling the Texture Combiner will result in lighting being broken in game. It's suggested to keep it off.
- When a lot of sounds are played simultaneously, framerate can hinder a bit (down to 30-40 fps).
- Music playback and sounds sometime can go out of sync and/or repeat small chunks (This is due to a bug in fluidsynth).

## Default Controls

- X = Jump (when enabled in Options)
- Start = Pause
- Select = Open AutoMap
- Up/Down = Zoom In/Out AutoMap
- Left/Right = Change Weapon
- Triangle/Circle = Change Weapon
